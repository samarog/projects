# ðŸ”· Don Simon: An Elemental Memory Game

A built-from-scratch web-based alternative to the classic **Simon Game**, featuring custom element themes (fire, water, air, and earth). Players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of button presses using mouse or keyboard.

## How to Play

- Press **"S"** to start the game.
- A sequence of elements will be shown (with sound and animation).
- Repeat the sequence by clicking the element buttons or using the arrow keys:
  - ^ `ArrowUp` â†’ Green (Earth)
  - v `ArrowDown` â†’ Blue (Water)
  - < `ArrowLeft` â†’ Yellow (Air)
  - > `ArrowRight` â†’ Red (Fire)
- The sequence gets longer each round.
- If you make a mistake, the game ends.
- Your highest score is saved locally in your browser.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** â€” semantic structure
- **CSS3** â€” animations, responsiveness, element-based themes
- **JavaScript** â€” core game logic and event handling
- **jQuery** â€” simplified DOM manipulation
