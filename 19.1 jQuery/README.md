# 🌀 Hello Worlds! An Interactive Visual Scene Showcase

An interactive visual project built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. This experience transforms scenes dynamically through theme-based buttons, applying animated image filters, text changes, and style transitions in real time. Designed as a creative playground for experimenting with visual effects and mood changes.

## 🎮 What It Does

- Displays a featured image with a dynamic title.
- Let users switch between themed visual styles:
  - 🌧️ Rain Forest (pretty much self explanatory...)
  - ✨ Orbitron District (Futuristic City)
  - 👽 ZORG (Alien Planet)
  - 🟡 Yellowcreek (Western)
  - 🔥 Blackfire Forge (Steampunk)
- Includes a **light/dark mode toggle** hidden in the sun.
- Applies `rotate`, `blur`, `fade`, `filter`, and `transform` effects.
- Reveals buttons on image click.
- Adds hover effects to titles and buttons.
- Fully responsive for smaller screens.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — semantic layout
- **CSS3** — styling, animations, responsive media queries. No frameworks.
- **jQuery** — simplified DOM manipulation
- **Google Fonts** — multiple custom typefaces for theme immersion
